# 🚚 Delivery Performance Dashboard

This project is a logistics-focused dashboard created in **Power BI** to track delivery loads, detect anomalies in weight, and analyze overall dispatch performance.

It aims to support logistics and operations teams by offering a clear view into inefficient patterns and opportunities for optimization.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

- Built to help logistics managers monitor dispatch trends, delivery weight patterns, and highlight outliers.
- Uses calculated columns, dynamic KPIs, and filters to enable interactive exploration.
- Provides visual clarity on unusual or inefficient deliveries that may require investigation.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

- **Power BI** (report building, KPIs, calculated fields)
- **Excel** (initial data cleanup)
- **DAX** (for metrics and filtering logic)

---

## 📌 Key Features

- ⚖️ **Weight Anomaly Detection**: Highlights deliveries with negative, zero, or overly heavy loads (>50 tonnes)
- 📆 **Dispatch Timeline Analysis**: Time-series chart showing dispatch activity
- 📍 **Route Breakdown**: Deliveries filtered by location, date, and vendor
- 📊 **KPI Cards**: Summarized total loads, average weights, and outlier count
- 🧮 **Calculated Columns**: Flags rows that violate logistic norms for review
